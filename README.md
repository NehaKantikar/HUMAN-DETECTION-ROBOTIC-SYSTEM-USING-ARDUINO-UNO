# HUMAN-DETECTION-ROBOTIC-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO-UNO

INTRODUCTION
A unique passive Infrared sensor is used in our design that emits infrared rays to detect humans. 
As a human body emits thermal radiation it will be received and manipulated by the PIR (Passive infrared sensor). 
Once a human target is located the system has to give an alert which may help to localize the victim location as soon as possible. 
The main design of the robot consists of a 'Human Detection Module' carried by a mobile robot platform sufficiently small enough to wander around the area and carry out its search activity.
The robot will be also equipped with a camera to transmit live video, of the disaster location, to the rescue team so that false alerts may be omitted and a visual contact with the victim would be executed.
The human detection module utilizes also an infrared LED lighting to show off the robotâ€™s surrounding under low or no light conditions. 
Human Detection Robot can be carried to any place in the world and can be assembled in some few hours for fast search and rescue operations. The design is simple with the cheapest budget.
